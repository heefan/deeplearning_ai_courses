# Data Model: Test Fix Implementation

**Feature**: Check Feature  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Design Complete  

## Core Entities

### TestFailure
**Purpose**: Represents a single test failure that needs to be fixed

**Fields**:
- `test_name`: string (required) - Full test path and name
- `category`: enum (required) - CLI, INTEGRATION, ADK, PROMPTS
- `priority`: enum (required) - CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- `error_message`: string (optional) - Specific error details
- `error_type`: string (required) - AssertionError, TypeError, ValidationError, etc.
- `file_path`: string (required) - Path to test file
- `line_number`: integer (optional) - Line where failure occurs
- `status`: enum (required) - PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, FIXED, VERIFIED
- `created_at`: datetime (required) - When failure was identified
- `fixed_at`: datetime (optional) - When fix was applied
- `verified_at`: datetime (optional) - When fix was verified

**Validation Rules**:
- test_name must be unique
- priority must align with category (ADK=CRITICAL, CLI=HIGH, etc.)
- status transitions: PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → FIXED → VERIFIED
- fixed_at must be after created_at
- verified_at must be after fixed_at

**State Transitions**:
- PENDING → IN_PROGRESS (when fix starts)
- IN_PROGRESS → FIXED (when fix is complete)
- FIXED → VERIFIED (when fix is tested)
- Any state → PENDING (if regression occurs)

### FixPlan
**Purpose**: Represents a planned fix for a test failure

**Fields**:
- `id`: string (required) - Unique identifier
- `test_failure_id`: string (required) - Reference to TestFailure
- `fix_type`: enum (required) - CODE_CHANGE, MOCK_UPDATE, PROMPT_UPDATE, CONFIG_CHANGE
- `description`: string (required) - Detailed fix description
- `estimated_effort`: integer (required) - Hours to complete
- `dependencies`: array of strings (optional) - Other fixes that must complete first
- `files_to_modify`: array of strings (required) - Files that need changes
- `validation_steps`: array of strings (required) - Steps to verify fix
- `status`: enum (required) - PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
- `created_at`: datetime (required) - When plan was created
- `started_at`: datetime (optional) - When implementation started
- `completed_at`: datetime (optional) - When implementation finished

**Validation Rules**:
- estimated_effort must be positive
- files_to_modify must exist in codebase
- validation_steps must be actionable
- status transitions: PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- dependencies must reference valid fix plans

### TestExecution
**Purpose**: Represents a test execution run

**Fields**:
- `id`: string (required) - Unique identifier
- `execution_time`: float (required) - Total execution time in seconds
- `total_tests`: integer (required) - Total number of tests run
- `passed_tests`: integer (required) - Number of tests that passed
- `failed_tests`: integer (required) - Number of tests that failed
- `skipped_tests`: integer (required) - Number of tests that were skipped
- `test_category`: enum (optional) - UNIT, INTEGRATION, E2E, ALL
- `execution_date`: datetime (required) - When tests were run
- `environment`: string (required) - Test environment details
- `test_failures`: array of TestFailure (required) - List of failures

**Validation Rules**:
- total_tests = passed_tests + failed_tests + skipped_tests
- execution_time must be positive
- test_failures array length must equal failed_tests count

### FixProgress
**Purpose**: Tracks overall progress of test fix implementation

**Fields**:
- `total_failures`: integer (required) - Total number of failures to fix
- `fixed_failures`: integer (required) - Number of failures fixed
- `verified_failures`: integer (required) - Number of fixes verified
- `remaining_failures`: integer (required) - Number of failures still pending
- `completion_percentage`: float (required) - Percentage of work completed
- `estimated_completion`: datetime (optional) - Estimated completion time
- `last_updated`: datetime (required) - When progress was last updated

**Validation Rules**:
- fixed_failures + remaining_failures = total_failures
- completion_percentage = (fixed_failures / total_failures) * 100
- completion_percentage must be between 0 and 100

## Relationships

### TestFailure → FixPlan (1:1)
- Each test failure has exactly one fix plan
- Fix plan is created when failure is identified
- Fix plan is updated as implementation progresses

### FixPlan → TestExecution (1:many)
- Each fix plan can be validated by multiple test executions
- Test execution results inform fix plan status
- Multiple executions may be needed to verify fix

### TestExecution → TestFailure (1:many)
- Each test execution can identify multiple failures
- Failures are extracted from execution results
- Execution provides context for failure analysis

## Data Validation Rules

### Cross-Entity Validation
- Fix plan dependencies must not create circular references
- Test failure categories must align with fix plan types
- Progress tracking must be consistent across entities

### Business Rules
- Critical failures (ADK) must be fixed before high priority (CLI)
- Integration test fixes may depend on unit test fixes
- E2E test fixes may depend on integration test fixes
- All fixes must be verified before marking complete

### Data Integrity
- Test failure records cannot be deleted once fix plan is created
- Fix plan status must be updated atomically
- Progress calculations must be recalculated when status changes
- Historical data must be preserved for analysis

## State Management

### TestFailure States
- **PENDING**: Failure identified, fix not started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Fix implementation in progress
- **FIXED**: Fix applied, awaiting verification
- **VERIFIED**: Fix confirmed working
- **REGRESSION**: Fix caused new failures

### FixPlan States
- **PLANNED**: Fix plan created, not started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Implementation in progress
- **COMPLETED**: Implementation finished
- **FAILED**: Implementation failed, needs revision

### Progress States
- **INITIAL**: No fixes started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Some fixes completed
- **NEAR_COMPLETE**: Most fixes done
- **COMPLETE**: All fixes verified
- **REGRESSION**: New failures introduced

This data model provides a comprehensive structure for tracking and managing the test fix implementation process.
