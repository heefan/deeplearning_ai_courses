# Feature Specification: Review Source Code and Update Planning Document

**Feature ID**: 001  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: In Development  

## Overview

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive review of the Essay Composer source code and updating the planning document to reflect the current implementation state, architecture decisions, and future development roadmap.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Scenarios

1. **Developer Review Scenario**
   - **Given**: A developer wants to understand the current codebase structure
   - **When**: They examine the source code and planning documentation
   - **Then**: They should find accurate, up-to-date information about the implementation

2. **Architecture Documentation Scenario**
   - **Given**: A stakeholder needs to understand the system architecture
   - **When**: They read the planning document
   - **Then**: They should see the actual implemented architecture with Google ADK agents

3. **Future Development Planning Scenario**
   - **Given**: A developer wants to plan future enhancements
   - **When**: They review the planning document
   - **Then**: They should have clear information about completed features and next steps

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Code Review Completeness**
   - Verify all source files are examined
   - Confirm architecture patterns are documented
   - Validate implementation details are captured

2. **Planning Document Accuracy**
   - Ensure planning document reflects actual implementation
   - Verify completed tasks are marked appropriately
   - Confirm future enhancement sections are updated

2. **Completeness**: All source files are reviewed and documented
3. **Clarity**: Architecture and implementation details are clearly explained for future developers
4. **Actionability**: Future development roadmap is clear and actionable

## Key Entities

### Source Code Components
- **Main Application**: `essay_composer.py` - CLI entry point
- **LM Studio Client**: `lmstudio_client.py` - API integration
- **Prompt Templates**: `prompts.py` - AI prompt management
- **ADK Agents**: `agents/` directory with specialized agents
- **Orchestrator**: `orchestrator.py` - Workflow coordination
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/` directory

### Architecture Elements
- **Google ADK Framework**: Agent-based architecture
- **Sequential Workflow**: Generation → Reflection → Revision
- **LM Studio Integration**: Local model execution
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line user interaction

## Assumptions

- The current implementation uses Google ADK framework as specified
- LM Studio is configured for local model execution
- All source files are accessible for review
- Planning document is the primary documentation target
- Future development will continue using the established architecture patterns

## Dependencies

- Access to complete source code repository
- Understanding of Google ADK framework
- Knowledge of LM Studio integration patterns
- Ability to update planning documentation

## Constraints

- Must maintain consistency with existing documentation style
- Should not modify actual source code during review
- Planning document updates should be comprehensive but concise
- Future enhancement suggestions should be realistic and actionable
