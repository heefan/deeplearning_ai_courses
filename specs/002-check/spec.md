2. **Configuration Validation Scenario**
   - **Given**: A user wants to verify their LM Studio setup
   - **When**: They check their configuration
   - **Then**: They should see connection status and configuration details

3. **Workflow Status Check Scenario**
   - **Given**: A user wants to understand available workflows
   - **When**: They request workflow information
   - **Then**: They should see detailed information about agent capabilities and workflow steps

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Connection Validation**
   - Verify LM Studio connectivity
   - Test model availability and responsiveness
   - Validate API endpoint configuration

2. **Configuration Verification**
   - Check required dependencies are installed
   - Verify environment setup
   - Validate model configuration

3. **Workflow Information Display**
   - Show available agents and their capabilities
   - Display workflow steps and requirements
   - Provide usage examples and guidance
