# Cursor Rules for Essay Composer

## Dependency Management
- Use `uv` for ALL Python dependency management (NO pip)
- Run `uv add <package>` to add new dependencies
- Use `uv run` to execute Python scripts
- Keep `requirements.txt` in sync with `pyproject.toml`
- Never use `pip install` directly

## Development Workflow
- Use `uv run python essay_composer.py` to run the main application
- Use `uv run python -m pytest` for testing (when tests are added)
- Use `uv sync` to install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code formatting
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and well-documented
