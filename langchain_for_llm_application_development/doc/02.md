# PromptTemplate

`0.2.3`

## what's difference between `StringPromptTemplates` and `ChatPromptTemplate` ?

## My Understanding:

ChatPromptTemplate is more general-purpose.
StringPromptTemplates are more customizable, allowing you to fully define roles such as system role, user role, and assistant role. This is useful for scenarios like GPTs where you want to control the thoughts of a chain template and output in a specific format.


## Traps
Lecture 2 seemed like a simple task, but it took me about 3 hours to complete.
The main issue was the unclear documentation and the fact that many sample codes do not work in version v0.2.3.
For example,
It suggests formatting the variable with the following code. In reality, you don't need the format function. You can pass the variables directly when invoking the language model.


```python
in_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=TEMPLATE_STRING, input_variables=["style", "text"])
out_prompt = in_prompt.format(style=CUSTOMER_STYLE, text=CUSTOMER_EMAIL)
```

Here, I should include the most reliable code to avoid common pitfalls.

## Tips

Correct: Use String Prompt Template

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(template="Hello, {name}!", input_variables=["name"])
result = prompt.format(name="Alice")
print(result)
```

Incorrect: 

```python
prompt = StringPromptTemplate(template="Hello, {name}!")
result = prompt.format(name="Alice")
```

Error `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class StringPromptTemplate with abstract method format`
It doesn't work in `0.2.3`
